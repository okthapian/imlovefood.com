Well this is one of my projects that I started around 2019. A website using Wordpress CMS with the Tailwind CSS style, wrapped in JQuery, the website that I originally used to share information about restaurants, food menus, and articles about food

## First plan
At first I just had a simple idea, I happen to be a person who likes data, one day I found restaurant data on the internet, after this I wanted to take advantage of it, finally the idea came up to create a website with restaurant reviews.
